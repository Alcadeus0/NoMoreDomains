Need to stop buying domain names? No More Domains blocks all the best known domain registrars and domain name auction sites to help you stop buying so many domains!

## How It Works

NoMoreDomains checks the URL of every site you visit to see if it is one of over 20 listed, known registrars. If the URL matches one of the listed registrars NoMoreDomains will make an immediate redirect away from that site to Google. While the extension is active you will not be able to access any of the listed registrars.
